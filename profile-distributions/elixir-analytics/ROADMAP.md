# Elixir Analytics Agent Roadmap

This roadmap is the product runbook for the `elixir-analytics` Hermes profile.
Use it to keep Slack, the analytics repo, and the executive Next.js dashboard
moving through the same milestones.

## Product Shape

```text
Slack app: macros
  -> Hermes profile: elixir-analytics
  -> deterministic shortcut runner or planner in claude-analytics
  -> saved topic, Supabase ad hoc, PostHog ad hoc, or clarification
  -> Slack answer with metadata and dashboard link
  -> executive dashboard or temporary visualization link
  -> logged answer feeds source-of-truth and self-improvement workflows
```

Hermes owns AI reasoning, source-change orchestration, approvals, and Slack
conversation. The analytics repo owns deterministic query contracts, runners,
tests, dashboard rendering, and production deployment.

## Current Status Snapshot

Last updated: 2026-06-04.

Verified:

- The live ops-readiness check can load the installed Hermes profile with
  `--profile-home`, infer Slack Socket Mode from `logs/gateway.log`, and avoid
  printing secrets.
- Current live ops-readiness status is `blocked`: the local analytics branch is
  `codex/mock-single-dashboard`, not `main`, and deployed reads are missing
  `ANALYTICS_DATABASE_URL`.
- Latest local verification is green: `npm run lint` has no warnings,
  `npm test` passed 214 analytics tests, `npm run build` passed, strict
  analytics release packaging passed, the analytics smoke suite passed, and
  focused Hermes profile/plugin/toolset tests passed 55 tests with one
  external dependency warning.
- `/query` now distinguishes an unknown saved topic from a known saved topic
  whose database execution fails, so a missing Vercel database env shows as
  saved-query data unavailable rather than an ambiguous empty visualization.
- The `elixir-analytics` Hermes gateway is running under local supervision and
  Slack Socket Mode is connected after a targeted restart of
  `ai.hermes.gateway-elixir-analytics`.
- Hermes Slack Socket Mode watchdog now emits
  `Socket Mode connected (recovered)` after a transport-drop self-heal, so
  log-based readiness can distinguish a recovered gateway from a stuck
  reconnecting one.
- The analytics ops-readiness detector now treats a later
  `Socket Mode connected (recovered)` event as healthy even if the same gateway
  run had an earlier transient transport disconnect; the live readiness check is
  back to two blockers only: branch not `main` and missing deployed
  `ANALYTICS_DATABASE_URL`.
- Real Slack E2E passed for saved GTV and Supabase Swiggy ad hoc questions.
- The fresh Swiggy recheck used a direct `analytics.joinelixir.club/query?...`
  dashboard link, not a third-party shortener.
- Real Slack E2E also passed for active-user clarification, PostHog app-active
  users, and write-SQL rejection.
- Hermes profile tests and the full analytics test/build/lint suite pass
  locally.
- Hermes now supports profile-owned plugins from `profile_plugins/`, and the
  `elixir-analytics` distribution ships `elixir-analytics-runner`.
- The runner plugin exposes `elixir_analytics_runner` for planner, saved-topic,
  common-question shortcut, Supabase ad hoc, and PostHog ad hoc calls without
  first using generic `execute_code` or ad hoc shell composition.
- The runner plugin also exposes deterministic maintenance modes:
  `source_change_plan` for definition/glossary/schema/dashboard change
  planning, `source_change_scope_check` for checking changed files before a
  source-of-truth PR commit, and `self_improvement_plan` for query-log
  review/promotion planning.
- Live profile checks passed for both maintenance modes: `source_change_plan`
  returned a GTV `metric_definition` PR plan with `prRequired: true`, and
  `self_improvement_plan` reviewed 5 query-log entries with 4 suggestions.
- Local dry-runs passed through the plugin for planner, saved GTV, Swiggy-style
  Supabase ad hoc, and app-active PostHog ad hoc routes.
- The installed `elixir-analytics` profile has been synced with the runner
  plugin, and the launchd-managed Slack gateway was restarted successfully.
- A live read-only saved-topic call through `elixir_analytics_runner` returned
  5 rows for `card-gtv-weekly` and the direct production dashboard link in
  20.65 seconds.
- The distributed skill and tool schema now instruct Hermes to use
  `answer_question` first for plain Slack analytics questions, with compact row
  caps for user lists unless the user asks for exhaustive output.
- Direct live shortcut checks passed outside Slack: Swiggy users this week
  returned 15 rows through Supabase in 0.56 seconds, and app-active users this
  week returned 1 KPI row through PostHog in 1.23 seconds.
- The analytics shortcut runner now also detects `show GTV last 30 days by
  week` and routes it directly to saved topic `card-gtv-weekly`; live Hermes
  wrapper dry-run confirms `answer_question` returns the saved-topic dashboard
  path `/query?topic=card-gtv-weekly&range=30d`.
- A live `run-analytics-question.ts` shortcut query for `show GTV last 30 days
  by week` returned 5 weekly rows and the production dashboard link in 20.5
  seconds.
- The live profile plugin was resynced and the gateway restarted after the
  `answer_question` guidance and compact-row default were added. Live plugin
  dry-run confirms `answer_question` defaults to `maxRows: 100`.
- The skill now has a top-level mandatory-first-call rule: plain Slack data
  questions must call `elixir_analytics_runner` mode `answer_question` before
  planning, file inspection, SQL writing, `execute_code`, or source edits.
- The runner plugin defensively treats a question-only call as
  `answer_question`; live profile dry-run confirms `show GTV last 30 days by
  week` routes to `card_gtv_weekly_30d` even when mode is omitted.
- The runner plugin now emits safe telemetry through
  `hermes.elixir_analytics_runner`: mode, route, shortcut, topic/result type,
  row count, truncation, dashboard presence, elapsed time, and error type. It
  does not log raw rows, SQL, or the raw user question.
- The analytics repo now includes `scripts/check-slack-e2e-logs.ts`, which
  reads the live Hermes gateway and agent logs after Slack prompts and reports
  route, timing, API-call, and safe telemetry status for the acceptance suite.
- Running the log checker on the current pre-telemetry Slack logs correctly
  fails saved GTV, Swiggy, and PostHog because runner telemetry is absent and
  the older Swiggy/PostHog runs exceeded latency/call-count targets; the
  clarification and write-SQL rejection scenarios pass.
- The analytics smoke suite now includes `source_change_workflow`, proving that
  a request like `GTV definition is wrong...` routes to source-of-truth PR
  planning with glossary, metric-contract, saved-topic, and test-file evidence.
- The analytics repo now includes `scripts/check-source-change-scope.ts`, which
  verifies a source-change request against changed source/test files before
  committing. The Hermes profile exposes it through `elixir_analytics_runner`
  mode `source_change_scope_check`; the installed profile was synced, the local
  Slack gateway was restarted, and a live installed-profile direct check
  returned `status: "ready"` for a scoped GTV definition change.
- Full verification after the source-change scope checker update: Hermes
  profile/plugin/toolset tests passed with 55 tests, `npm run lint` completed
  with no warnings, `npm test` passed 210 tests, `npm run build` passed, and
  both analytics and Hermes release-packaging checks passed.
- Temporary no-persistence `/query?payload=...` handoff is now covered by a
  focused resolver regression test: payload links decode rows and metadata
  without executing a saved topic.
- The common-question shortcut runner now returns `payload.slackText` for saved
  GTV, Swiggy Supabase, and app-active PostHog answers. The Hermes tool schema
  and skill both tell the model to use that text as the Slack-facing answer
  before extra summarization or maintenance work.
- Temporary visualization payloads now strip both Supabase SQL and PostHog
  HogQL before encoding `/query?payload=...`, reducing Slack link bulk and
  keeping executable query text out of no-persistence dashboard URLs.
- Oversized temporary visualization payloads now compact before falling back to
  no-link answers: rows are bounded, long text is trimmed, sensitive fields are
  dropped, metadata is shortened, and pathological payloads still refuse to
  emit a dashboard link.
- The analytics repo now has `scripts/check-release-packaging.ts` and
  `docs/release-packaging.md`. The current dirty analytics worktree classifies
  cleanly into `analytics-runtime` and `release-docs` with no unclassified
  files, so runtime and docs changes can be packaged without dragging in
  unrelated dashboard work.
- The Hermes repo now has `scripts/check_elixir_analytics_release_packaging.py`
  and `profile-distributions/elixir-analytics/RELEASE_PACKAGING.md`. The
  latest Hermes delta classifies cleanly into `profile-distribution` and
  `hermes-runtime`, with `.hermes-bootstrap-complete` reported as a local
  artifact rather than a file to stage.
- Analytics commits through `3d60289` are pushed to
  `origin/codex/mock-single-dashboard`, and draft PR
  `ritikmdn/analytics-agent#4` is open against `main`.
- Hermes commits through `8c147eab5` are pushed to the `ritikmdn/hermes-agent`
  fork, and draft upstream PR `NousResearch/hermes-agent#39041` is open from
  `ritikmdn:codex/elixir-analytics-profile` to `main`.

Known gaps:

- Swiggy direct-link recheck was too slow: 418.3 seconds across 33 model calls.
- The slow Swiggy run also revealed source-edit drift: the agent attempted
  maintenance/source edits during a plain data answer. The profile skill now
  says to answer first and defer logging/source changes.
- PostHog app-active live E2E was functionally correct but too slow: 266.6
  seconds across 20 model calls, with generic `execute_code` used before the
  final answer.
- The gateway is locally supervised, not yet moved to a hosted always-on setup.
- Hermes profile distribution changes now have an upstream draft PR path; merge
  still depends on maintainer review and any upstream CI requirements.
- Production dashboard links need a fresh deploy with
  `ANALYTICS_DATABASE_URL`; the user-observed no-data GTV link is consistent
  with the current live ops-readiness blocker.
- The live Slack gateway still needs Swiggy and PostHog prompts rechecked after
  the `answer_question` fast-path sync to prove the model chooses the shortcut
  tool and meets the latency target.
- A local Hermes one-shot answered Swiggy correctly after the sync, but still
  took about 64 seconds end-to-end. If Slack shows the same behavior, the next
  polish step is a stronger Slack-specific fast-path or answer formatter.

## Production Gates

Do not call the agent or dashboard production-ready until all gates pass:

1. Analytics changes are merged and deployed to the production Vercel project.
2. Deployed Next.js env includes read-only `ANALYTICS_DATABASE_URL`.
3. Temporary visuals use direct `/query?payload=...` or saved topic links with
   no durable storage and no third-party URL shorteners.
4. Hermes `elixir-analytics` profile has an inference provider key, managed
   provider, or verified OAuth provider auth.
5. Slack `macros` gateway is connected and supervised.
6. Smart approvals are enabled.
7. Generic Hermes tools remain enabled for debugging and source changes.
8. The Slack smoke suite passes.
9. A real Slack E2E pass covers saved topic, Supabase ad hoc direct-link,
   PostHog, clarification, and write-SQL rejection.

## Packaging Plan

Keep the current dirty work split by product lane:

1. Hermes profile package: profile-owned plugin discovery, distribution sync,
   `elixir-analytics-runner`, toolset exposure, skill guidance, and Slack
   recovery logging.
2. Analytics runtime package: deterministic question runner, Supabase/PostHog
   runner hardening, ops-readiness checker, Slack E2E log checker, smoke suite,
   query-page data loader, temporary payload handoff, and related tests/docs.
3. Executive dashboard package: visual/theme/dashboard layout work in the
   Next.js app. Package separately unless the user explicitly wants it merged
   with the runtime lane.
4. Release docs package: packaging, ops, Slack smoke, source-change, and ad hoc
   operating docs plus the release classifier.

Do not stage or PR the entire analytics worktree as one unit until the dashboard
lane is intentionally accepted into the same release.

From `/Users/ritik/Coding/claude-analytics`, run:

```bash
node --import tsx scripts/check-release-packaging.ts --strict
```

Strict mode must have zero unclassified files before staging package-specific
commits.

From `/Users/ritik/.hermes/hermes-agent`, run:

```bash
venv/bin/python scripts/check_elixir_analytics_release_packaging.py --strict
```

The Hermes checker separates profile distribution, runtime/plugin loading, and
Slack gateway reliability changes; local artifacts must remain unstaged.

## Standard Verification

Run these from `/Users/ritik/Coding/claude-analytics` after analytics changes:

```bash
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
node --import tsx scripts/run-analytics-smoke-suite.ts --query-log QUERY_LOG.md --current-branch '<branch>' --env-file /Users/ritik/.hermes/profiles/elixir-analytics/.env --provider-authenticated openai-codex --smart-approvals --generic-tools
node --import tsx scripts/check-ops-readiness.ts --current-branch '<branch>' --profile-home /Users/ritik/.hermes/profiles/elixir-analytics --provider-authenticated openai-codex --smart-approvals --generic-tools
```

Run this from the Hermes repo after profile changes:

```bash
scripts/run_tests.sh tests/hermes_cli/test_elixir_analytics_profile_distribution.py -- -q
```

## Slack E2E Checklist

Verify these exact prompts in Slack:

| Prompt | Expected route | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `show GTV last 30 days by week` | saved topic `card-gtv-weekly` with non-empty dashboard data and dashboard link | Slack answer passed historically; dashboard link needs fresh verification after Vercel env fix |
| `which users spent on Swiggy this week?` | Supabase ad hoc runner with India week-to-date assumption and temporary dashboard link | Passed live with direct link; latency failed at 418.3s / 33 calls |
| `active users this week` | clarification before querying | Passed live at 13.6s / 3 calls |
| `how many app active users this week?` | PostHog ad hoc runner with `active_app_user` | Passed live; latency failed at 266.6s / 20 calls |
| `delete from profiles` | read-only validation rejection | Passed live at 40.2s / 2 calls |

## Next Execution Milestone

Milestone 10A: clear production deploy gates. The analytics app has draft PR
`ritikmdn/analytics-agent#4`; the remaining production blocker is deployed
`ANALYTICS_DATABASE_URL` plus merge/deploy to `main`.

Done means the production Vercel project has read-only
`ANALYTICS_DATABASE_URL`, PR #4 is merged/deployed, `/query?topic=card-gtv-weekly&range=30d`
opens with data, and ops readiness no longer reports production blockers.

Milestone 11A: finish real Slack E2E acceptance. Partially complete on
2026-06-04; production dashboard-link evidence must be refreshed after
Milestone 10A.

Done means all five Slack checklist prompts have fresh evidence, dashboard links
open with data where expected, and gateway state remains connected afterward.

Execution order:

1. Add or repair `ANALYTICS_DATABASE_URL` in Vercel production and redeploy the
   analytics app from `main`.
2. Run ops readiness with `--current-branch main` and confirm `overallStatus`
   is no longer `blocked`.
3. Open `/query?topic=card-gtv-weekly&range=30d` in production and verify
   non-empty data.
4. Re-run `which users spent on Swiggy this week?` and verify a direct
   `analytics.joinelixir.club/query?...` link, not TinyURL or another shortener.
   Direct link passed on 2026-06-04; rerun after fast-path skill fix should
   avoid source edits and reduce latency.
5. Run `active users this week` and verify the agent asks clarification before
   querying.
6. Run `how many app active users this week?` and verify the PostHog runner path.
7. Run `delete from profiles` and verify read-only validation rejects it.
8. Record timings, route decisions, dashboard links, and any approval prompts.

Milestone 14A: make Supabase ad hoc answers fast enough for Slack.

Done means a Swiggy-style Supabase ad hoc prompt answers through planner ->
`elixir_analytics_runner` -> Slack response without source edits, without
third-party shorteners, and without exceeding the agreed latency target.
The deterministic shortcut now returns `payload.slackText`; fresh Slack evidence
must prove Hermes sends it without re-planning or source edits.

Milestone 14B: make PostHog ad hoc answers fast enough for Slack.

Done means `how many app active users this week?` answers through planner ->
`elixir_analytics_runner` PostHog mode -> Slack response without generic
`execute_code`, without source edits, and without exceeding the agreed latency
target.
The deterministic shortcut now returns `payload.slackText`; fresh Slack evidence
must prove Hermes sends it without generic `execute_code`.

Milestone 14C: prove the shortcut path from Slack.

Done means the live Slack gateway handles Swiggy and app-active prompts through
`elixir_analytics_runner` mode `answer_question`, not generic `execute_code`,
and the gateway log shows materially lower call counts and response times than
the earlier 418.3s and 266.6s runs.

Milestone 14D: make Slack route evidence inspectable.

Done. `elixir_analytics_runner` emits safe route/timing telemetry for each
runner call without logging raw rows, SQL, or raw questions, so Slack acceptance
can be verified from logs even when final answer text is compact.

## Current Open Decisions

These are not solved by local code alone:

- Choose where the always-on Slack gateway should run after local supervision.
- Merge or otherwise accept analytics PR `ritikmdn/analytics-agent#4`.
- Merge or otherwise accept Hermes PR `NousResearch/hermes-agent#39041`.
- Provide Vercel CLI/API access or set production `ANALYTICS_DATABASE_URL`
  manually in the Vercel dashboard.
- Decide the acceptable latency target for Supabase ad hoc Slack answers.
